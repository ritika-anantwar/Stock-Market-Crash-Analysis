# Stock-Market-Crash-Analysis

# I. Overview:

Stock market crashes are periods of rapid and significant declines in market values. Understanding these events and their precursors can provide valuable insights into market dynamics and help develop early warning systems. This project involves the analysis of 30 years of historical Indian stock market data to build an early warning system (EWS) to detect signs of an upcoming crash. This might help data scientists and analysts manage risk and make informed investment decisions.

# III. The analysis included:

1. Calculating metrics like daily returns, drawdowns, rolling 10-day average returns and volatility.
2. Grouping consecutive days of market stress into distinct crash clusters using the calculated metrics.
3. Identifying major market crashes of 1997, 2008â€“2009, and 2020 using daily percentage changes and drawdown methods.
4. Visualizing and comparing the different crash periods to uncover unique market behaviours.
5. Developing an early warning system (EWS) using rolling statistics of returns and volatility.
